# Autocomplete Search Results with Authoritative NYC Address Data

This package imports authoritative NYC address data from the [Property Address Directory (PAD)](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data.page#pad) into [Pelias](https://github.com/pelias/pelias) (A modular, open-source geocoder built on top of ElasticSearch for fast geocoding).
